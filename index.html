        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Your data is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted in transit using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols</li>
            <li>Stored securely using enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure</li>
            <li>Access-controlled with strict authentication requirements</li>
            <li>Regularly backed up to prevent data loss</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Some data (such as scan history and saved items) is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate our app:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Authentication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> For secure user authentication. Apple's Privacy Policy applies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These third-party services have their own privacy policies governing the use of your information. We recommend reviewing their policies.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>

        <p>
            BlackScan requires camera access to scan products. We use a combination of on-device and cloud-based processing to identify products:
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 On-Device Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial text recognition (OCR) is performed locally on your device</li>
            <li>When on-device analysis produces high-quality results, no images leave your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Cloud-Based Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When on-device OCR quality is insufficient, product images may be sent to OpenAI's API for advanced analysis using their GPT-4 Vision technology</li>
            <li>Images are transmitted securely over HTTPS and are processed by OpenAI in accordance with their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">API data usage policy</a></li>
            <li>OpenAI does not use API inputs to train their models</li>
            <li>Images are not stored permanently by BlackScan or OpenAI after processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Your Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can revoke camera access at any time through your device settings, though this will limit core scanning functionality</li>
            <li>No images are saved to your device or our servers after scanning is complete</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> When you explicitly agree to share information</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted third-party service providers who assist in operating our app (under strict confidentiality agreements)</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If BlackScan is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or to protect our rights and safety</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share anonymized, aggregated data that cannot identify you personally</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
